# match.call, a pitall in R

Sometimes you write a function A in which you call another function B, but you don't want to specify each single arguments defined by function B. So a solution is to use `...` after the last argument in A, using `match.call()` or `sys.call` to get all arguments, process all the arguments, and finally pass all arguments to function B using `do.call`. Here is a example. We define function `my_sum` which sum up three numbers together, and a function `sqr_sum` that square each number then sum them up.

```
my_sum = function(x, y, z){
    return(x + y + z)
}
sqr_sum = function(...){
    args = as.list(match.call())[-1]
    args = lapply(args, function(x) x^2)
    do.call(my_sum, args)
}
sqr_sum(x = 2, y = 3, z = 4)
# [1] 29
```

This is perfect, except if we are trying to call the `sqr_sum` inaother function. The `add_sqr_sum` function now add a value to each function, and then call the `sqr_sum`

```
add_sqr_sum = function(x, y, z){
    x = x + 5
    y = y + 6
    z = z + 7
    sqr_sum(x = x, y = y, z = z)
}
add_sqr_sum(2,3,4)
# Error in x^2 : non-numeric argument to binary operator 
```

If we use the `traceback` function we'll see the error occurs inside the `sqr_sum` function. So apparently we have the `x`, but it's not a numeric. Let's modify the `sqr_sum` function to print out thr `args` to see what really is going on.

```
sqr_sum = function(...){
    args = as.list(match.call())[-1]
    print(args)
    # args = lapply(args, function(x) x^2)
    # do.call(my_sum, args)
}
add_sqr_sum(2,3,4)
# $x
# x
# 
# $y
# y
# 
# $z
# z
```

So each element of the `args` list is no longer a numeric value, but a unevaluated `symbol`. And if we call `sqr_sum` directly it is fine.

```
sqr_sum(2,3,4)
# $x
# [1] 2
# 
# $y
# [1] 3
# 
# $z
# [1] 4
```

But the same problem happens if call `sqr_sum` directly using a global variable.

```
x = 2
sqr_sum(x = x, y = 3, z = 4)
# $x
# x
# 
# $y
# [1] 3
# 
# $z
# [1] 4
```

After working on this for hours, I finally found my solution. The solution is actually pretty easy. We just need to `eval` it if we got a `symbol`. After I add the new line in the sqr_sum function, it works fine.

```
sqr_sum = function(...){
    args = as.list(match.call())[-1]
    call.envir = parent.frame(1)
    args = lapply(args, function(arg){
        if(is.symbol(arg)){
            eval(arg, envir = call.envir)
        } else {
            arg
        }
    })
    args = lapply(args, function(x) x^2)
    do.call(my_sum, args)
}
sqr_sum(x = x, y = 3, z = 4)
# 29
add_sqr_sum(2,3,4)
# 251
```

While trying to figure this out, I also found another pitfall in the `match.call` function. 

```
# Usage
match.call(definition = sys.function(sys.parent()),
           call = sys.call(sys.parent()),
           expand.dots = TRUE,
           envir = parent.frame(2L))
```

The documentation of `match.call` says that the `definition` and `call` are using the parent environment which is the environment where the function with `match.call` inside is called. And the `envir` uses the grand-parent environment. But this is not true. Although this function is a internal function that we can not see the source code, but after I tried some combinations, the default parameter is actually below.

```
match.call(definition = sys.function(0),
           call = sys.call(0),
           expand.dots = TRUE,
           envir = parent.frame(2L))
```
