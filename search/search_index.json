Here I listed some good courses that I took. Tip Coursera's courses aren't cheap. If you buy one course at a time, it's usually $79 per course. If you subscript a specialization (which is a series of courses) it's $49 per month. However, if you don't have any credit cards bonded to the website yet(or register a new account if you already did), you can audit without paying anything. You can't take quizzes, submit any projects, or get any certificate. But if you just want to learn the material, it might be a good choice. Data Science Specialization \u00b6 @coursera, by JHU This is a very thorough and well-structured series courses with 10 courses about statistics and R, hosted by the department od Biostatistics in John Hopkins University. It stats with the very basic R programming, then into statistics theoreis (distribution and linear model). It has a very inspiring course called \"reproducible research\" which I think is extremely necessary for us when handling with big datasets. Same as the one below, this specialization is free to audit, and $49 per month is you enroll it to get certificates. The first week is free, and I finished the 9/10 in only two months. Genomic Data Science \u00b6 @coursera, by JHU This is also a series course with 8 courses, also hosted by JHU. This course is extremely useful especially when you want to work with microbiome data, proteomic data, or any HTS(high through-put sequencing) data. It covers the NGS sequencing theory, and the genomic sequences alignment algorithm (with python), unix system operation (most genomic tools were developed in linux platform, such as the QIIME2), and then data analysis. Bioinformaitcs Specialization \u00b6 @coursera, by UCSD This is an replacement of the course above. It was recommended by many people but I didn't take it. Python for Everybody \u00b6 @coursera, by UMich A wonderful series of courses of python for absolute beginners. The professor is very funny and very easy to understand. It teaches the most fundamental data structure and programming skills of python.","title":"Online Courses"},{"location":"moocs/#data-science-specialization","text":"@coursera, by JHU This is a very thorough and well-structured series courses with 10 courses about statistics and R, hosted by the department od Biostatistics in John Hopkins University.

By the time that I wrote this, qiime2's DADA2 function is much slower (plus there is some problem that we haven't solved of using qiime2's dada2). However, qiime2 is embedded with the fasttree tool. So if you want to use it to build a phylogenic tree, please read the tutorial in qiime2 website, and make sure to use the latest version. DADA2 Tutorial \u00b6 The original dada2 is a R package available on bioconductor. PICRUSt Tutorial with de novo Variants \u00b6 This tutorial allows you to use dada2 output to do function prediction with PICRUSt. Phyloseq \u00b6 Phyloseq is a package that dedicated for microbiome data analysis. It can calculate the alpha diversity, and beta diversity with different methods (unifrac, bray curtis, etc.). But it does not have a phylogenic tree building method which is required by the unifrac method. So you will need to use the qiime2 before phyloseq. The phyloseq's plotting functions are very capsulized, and not very flexible.","title":"Tutorials"},{"location":"tutorials/#qiime2","text":"Qiime2 is actively under developing, with new version released every other month.
